Udemy
I'm really stretching here. I'm a geek when it comes to hardware and built my current Window 7 64 bit machine three years ago. I'm running Linux mint on my laptop and 
a backup desktop pc
With some html and web building classes, minimal experimenting with Ruby and Python some years ago I'm going with total immersion here.

I intend to freelance when it comes together and currently studying Blockchain for Business with classes waiting in the wings for MySQL, Introduction to Java Programming with edX
and 6 other computer science courses through eduonix. One at a time plus the blockchain studies.
